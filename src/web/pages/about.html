            When I was in school, the only subject that constantly piqued my interest was mathematics. Later, university happened where I studied engineering. And again, if there was math anywhere, I had the most fun at it. Alongside, I discovered programming as a skill and went onto become a software engineer. But I found myself going back to math problems in my free time.

            However, good problems are hidden inside textbooks. To find good problems, I needed to bury myself in good textbooks. Good textbooks are often expensive. For someone who just wants to continuously solve problems, going through and keeping a track of all the textbooks began to feel like a hassle. I wished for a website that could just dump all the math problems available in the world out there. And if I could filter the problems by topics, that would be beautiful.

            teachyourselfmath is a side project that was born out of this need. At its core, it a math PDF extraction engine. The engine has some machine learning going on behind the scenes to extract math problems in LaTeX from any image or document. I do not wish to make money out of this and I am happy to bear the server costs here because I feel like this is a resource that should just exist.

            If this website appeals to the math nerd inside you, I would love to hear your <a href="https://tally.so/r/w2PxRV">feedback</a>.
